## How to play
There is a deck of cards with paired images. The deck is laid out in random order, face down. The player can open 2 cards in one move. If a “pair” is formed when the cards are opened, it remains open. The game continues until the entire field is open.
The goal of the game is to open a field of 3 by 4 cards in 1 minute.
